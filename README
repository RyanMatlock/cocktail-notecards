This is my attempt at neatly organizing my cocktail recipes in an aesthetically
pleasing way.  Since I began this project---long before putting it on
Github---I've gotten better about attributing sources, although in some cases
going back might to find a recipe's origin might be a bit difficult.  If some
of the proportions look a little weird, it's because I'm trying to ensure that
the drinks fit in my glassware---5.5oz coupes, 8.5oz old fashioned glasses, and
10.5oz Collins glasses.
